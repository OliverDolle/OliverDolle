    <h2>ðŸŽ“ About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Technology at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Alongside my studies, I am employed as a Student Assistant in the AI & Automation department at Nordic Transport Group (NTG), where I contribute to intelligent systems and workflow optimization.

My primary interests lie within embedded systems, industrial automation, and remote-controlled technologies. I thrive in environments that combine hardware and software, and I am passionate about building robust and scalable solutions.</p>

<h2 align="center" class="section-heading">ðŸ’» Programming Languages</h2>
<p> As a software technology student at DTU, I am continuously expanding my knowledge of programming languages and development tools. My academic journey has introduced me to various paradigms, from object-oriented and functional programming to low-level hardware interaction.

Iâ€™m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and always eager to learn new languages or deepen my understanding of existing ones. Whether itâ€™s diving into memory management in C++ or prototyping quick solutions in Python, I enjoy the challenge each language brings.</p>
